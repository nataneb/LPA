The repository includes the scalable implementations of label propagation algorithms for node labeling in bipartite graphs.

The implementations are done on top of Grappa, a modern distributed shared memory system. We used its GraphLab-like vertex-centric API.
To run the program, we need a binary file, which is done by using Makefile. The example of it is provided in this repository. More details to install Grappa and run programs on top of it can be found at http://grappa.io/.
